<div>
    Executes the code inside the block with a determined time out limit.
    If the time limit is reached, an exception (org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.steps.FlowInterruptedException) is thrown, which leads to aborting
    the build (unless it is caught and processed somehow).

    <p>Use the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/pipeline-snippet-generator">Pipeline Snippet Generator</a> to generate a sample pipeline script for the timeout step.</p>
