<div>
    Recursively deletes the current directory and its contents.
    Symbolic links and junctions will not be followed but will be removed.
    To delete a specific directory of a workspace wrap the <code>deleteDir</code>
    step in a <code>dir</code> step. For example:
</div>
<p><pre>
    stage('Setup') {
    steps {
        dir ('bin') {
            deleteDir()
        }
     }

    }
</pre></p>
