<div>
    Retry the block (up to N times) if any exception happens during its body execution.
    If an exception happens on the final attempt then it will lead to aborting the build (unless it is caught and processed somehow).
    User aborts of the build are <em>not</em> caught.
</div>

<p>Example:
<pre><code>
    retry(5) {
    // some block
    }
</code></pre>
</p>
